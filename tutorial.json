The second should be to only show items where the bike hasn't been returned yet. You can do that with `date_returned IS NULL`\n`SELECT * FROM bikes LEFT OUTER JOIN rentals ON bikes.bike_id = rentals.bike_id LEFT OUTER JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = rentals.customer_id WHERE phone='$PHONE_NUMBER' AND date_returned is null;`",
