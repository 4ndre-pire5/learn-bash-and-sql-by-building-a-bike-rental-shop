          "content": "Okay, this isn't bad. I wonder if you can make this a little prettier. Instead of directly echoing your bikes to the screen, `pipe` the output into a `while` loop that reads each word. Here's how that looks:\n\n```sh\necho \"$AVAILABLE_BIKES\" | while read BIKE_ID BAR1 TYPE BAR2 SIZE\ndo\n  echo $BIKE_ID $TYPE $SIZE\ndone\n```\n\nIt will read the first line of your results into those five variables for you to use in the `do` area. When it gets to a new line, it reads the next five words into the variables again.",
